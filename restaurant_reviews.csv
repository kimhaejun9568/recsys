Register as a member at Pole Cafe and receive 5% points. Oh, but this is happening now. When I came out to the parking lot behind the cafe, I found out about the coin karaoke room, screen golf course, and Cheongju hangover soup, and it turned out that they were all affiliated. It's a perfect place to play on the course.

The soba itself didn't have a special taste, but it was faithful to the basics and the additional main ingredients went well together, so I found a new delicious combination. And it was a pork cutlet that I didn't expect. It was bigger than I expected and the pork cutlet meat was meaty, but the batter was so rich and crunchy that it felt like I was eating delicious snacks. I was happy to see the unexpected income.
